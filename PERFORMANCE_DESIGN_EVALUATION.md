## 🎨 Design System Analysis

### 🟡 **Design Consistency Issues**

1. **Theme Fragmentation** (Major Issue)
   ```typescript
   // Found 5 different theme/color systems:
   - /constants/Colors.ts
   - /constants/DesignSystem.ts 
   - /theme/Theme.ts
   - /services/advancedThemeManager.ts
   - /hooks/useTheme.ts (multiple variations)
   ```

2. **Color Property Conflicts**
   ```typescript
   // Missing 'accent' and 'card' properties in current theme
   // Causing 32 TypeScript errors in EnhancedCarDetailsView
   colors.accent // ❌ Not defined
   colors.card   // ❌ Not defined
   ```

3. **Spacing Inconsistencies**
   ```typescript
   // Different spacing systems:
   Spacing.xs: 4    // /constants/Colors.ts
   Spacing.xs: 4    // /constants/DesignSystem.ts  
   Spacing.xs: 2    // /theme/Theme.ts ⚠️
   ```

### 📱 **UI Component Issues**

1. **Missing Components**
   - PremiumButton.tsx (referenced but doesn't exist)
   - Some UI components not properly exported

2. **Import Inconsistencies**
   ```typescript
   // Gesture handlers imported from wrong location
   import { PanGestureHandler } from 'react-native'; // ❌
   // Should be:
   import { PanGestureHandler } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
   ```
