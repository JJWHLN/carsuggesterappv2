## Created Solutions

### 1. **Unified Data Fetching Hook**
```typescript
// Single hook replaces useApi, useDataFetching, useInfiniteScroll
const { data, loading, error, refresh, loadMore } = useUnifiedDataFetching(
  fetchFunction,
  dependencies,
  { enablePagination: true, enableSearch: true }
);
```

### 2. **Unified Screen State Component**
```typescript
// Single component handles all screen states
<UnifiedScreenState
  loading={loading}
  error={error}
  data={data}
  onRetry={retry}
>
  {/* Content */}
</UnifiedScreenState>
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Theme Hook**
```typescript
// Single hook provides all theme/styling needs
const { colors, commonStyles, createThemedStyles } = useComprehensiveTheme();
```

```typescript
// Single hook handles all navigation patterns
const { navigateToCarDetails, navigateToSearch } = useUnifiedNavigation();
```
