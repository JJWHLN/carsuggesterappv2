);

// Example: Apply accessibility settings
themeManager.updateThemeSettings({
  highContrast: true,
  colorBlindFriendly: true
});
```

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Example: Monitor search performance
const searchTime = await performanceMonitor.measureAsync(
  'search_operation',
  async () => performSearch(query)
);

// Example: Track component renders
performanceMonitor.trackRender('SearchScreen', renderTime);
```

### 4. **Offline Capabilities**
