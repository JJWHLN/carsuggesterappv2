# CarSuggester App - Comprehensive Architecture Implementation Report

## Session Summary: Building Practical Car App Architecture (9 AM - 3 PM)

### Background
Started with user feedback: "work on the issues you identified in your cynical review" and "provide a plan for today" with focus on building proper app architecture rather than over-engineering. User emphasized: "I will add the review data and I cannot add the data for the dealers that havent joined us yet. I need to work on the architecture of the app"
